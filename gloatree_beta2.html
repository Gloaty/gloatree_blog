<h1 style="text-align: center;"><em>The Gloatree</em></h1><h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What is the Gloatree?</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;">The Gloatree is an online blog for the persona of Gloaty, an online identity which I use online. My friends know my real name, but you probably don't.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Interests</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gaming</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;">At the time of writing, I am a big fan of Call of Duty, but not Warzone. I seem to have a special affinity for the Zombies mode. Cold War zombies is the one that I am currently knee deep into, but I am also a big fan of Black Ops 3 Zombies, but, I admit, I play it less often.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;">Coding</h4><p style="text-align: center;">As of writing, I really love coding, as you may have been able to gather, since I did actually code this website by scratch. I know there are many tools to let you build websites without needing to do any coding, but I desired a challenge when building something as big as a website.</p><p style="text-align: center;">In the time that I have been doing programming, I have learned to rite in a few languages, suce as Python, C++, and HTML. The last one, you may have guessed, as I need HTML knowledge in order to code, and thus, build this website. </p>
