<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>The Gloatree</em></span></h1><h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What is the Gloatree?</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;">The Gloatree is an online blog for the persona of Gloaty, an online identity which I use online. My friends know my real name, but you probably don't.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Interests</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gaming</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;">At the time of writing, I am a big fan of Call of Duty, but I have a special burning hatred for Warzone, which I can't really explain, but I definitely feel it. I seem to have a special affinity for the Zombies mode. Cold War zombies is the one that I am currently knee deep into, but I am also a big fan of Black Ops 3 Zombies, but, I admit, I play it less often.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;">Coding</h4><p style="text-align: center;">As of writing, I really love coding, as you may have been able to gather, since I did actually code this website by scratch. I know there are many tools to let you build websites without needing to do any coding, but I desired a challenge when building something as big as a website.</p><p style="text-align: center;">In the time that I have been doing programming, I have learned to rite in a few languages, suce as Python, C++, and HTML. The last one, you may have guessed, as I need HTML knowledge in order to code, and thus, build this website.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Achievements</h2><h4 style="text-align: center;">Gaming Achievements</h4><h5 style="text-align: center;">Call of Duty Zombies</h5><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>WARNING: GAME SPOILERS AHEAD!&nbsp;</strong></em></span></p><p style="text-align: center;">In Call of Duty Zombies, especially Cold War, I have completed the Easter Eggs for Die Maschine and Forsaken. I thought that the end of the Forsaken Easter Egg was incredibly bittersweet.</p><p style="text-align: center;">The ending with every major hand at requiem being arrested, I thoght was incredibly bitter, but with the Forsaken being captured and taken away, that part was quite sweet, as it was a victory for requiem, before the director decides to rain on their parade. Also, the part where the director's face is revealed to be someone that is, or at least looks like Edward Richtofen was mindblowing. So yeah, a bit mindblowing, and quite bittersweet.</p><p style="text-align: center;">There isn't much to say about the Die machine Easter Egg, since it is a bit cut and dry, the particle accelerator is destroyed, and some of the outbreak zones have closed. The only sad parts about is Nacht der Untoten's destruction in the explosion, which means that there probably won't be another Nacht der Untoten map, apart from remasters of maps where it appears.</p><p style="text-align: center;">I think the developers making the Easter Eggs easier is okay. It allows those that are new to the series to complete their first quest, even me. My first quest was Die Maschine's quest. I have seen many classic zombies people dislike this change, but it's their opinion, and I can't change it, and I respect their opinions. <p style="text-align: center;">I have also hit some decent high rounds in Die Maschine and Mauer der Toten. I think that my highest round on Die Maschine is aroung 45, and Mauer der Toten is around the same as Die Maschine.</p><h5 style="text-align: center;">Call of Duty Multiplayer</h5><p style="text-align: center;">In the Multiplayer mode of Call of Duty, mainly Modern Warfare 2019's Multiplayer, I have made some videos of my gameplay, typically regarding matches that I thought were interesting, fun or relatively easy.</p><p style="text-align: center;">These videos can be found on my Youtube channel, which can be found at the bottom of this website.</p>
